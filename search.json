This data-set contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoker, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, wheezing, swallowing difficulty, clubbing of finger nails and snoring.\nThe data-set contained clean data, as all individuals were actual patients part of a study publish in the journal Natural Medicine about Health Effects of Air Pollution in China. Read more about the article to find out about interesting details of how the study was done, and other conclusions that came out of it."

Using data from from a study done by the journal Nature Medicine on over 462,000 people in China who lived in areas with varying levels of air pollution, we seek to understand the relationship between risk of lung cancer and air pollution. We modeled people living in various atmospheric conditions, a categorical variable, as a categorical function of Lung Cancer Risk. Individuals with worse conditions were more likely to be prone to Lung Cancer."
