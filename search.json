Using data from from a study done by the journal Nature Medicine on over 462,000 people in China who lived in areas with varying levels of air pollution, we seek to understand the relationship between risk of lung cancer and air pollution. We modeled people living in various atmospheric conditions, a categorical variable, as a categorical function of Lung Cancer Risk. Individuals with worse conditions were more likely to be prone to Lung Cancer."
