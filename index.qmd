*Modeling the relationships between Lung Cancer and other various factors such as air pollution, smoking, obesity, etc. to understand better treatment and prevention of it.*



## Project Summary

Lung Cancer is the 2nd most common cancer affecting the United States in 2024. Using data from from a study done by the journal Nature Medicine on over 462,000 people in China who lived in areas with varying levels of air pollution, we seek to understand the relationship between risk of lung cancer and air pollution. We modeled people living in various atmospheric conditions, a categorical variable, as a categorical function of Lung Cancer Risk. Individuals with worse conditions were more likely to be prone to Lung Cancer.
