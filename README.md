# Lung-Cancer-Prediction

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States in 2024. This project aims to understand the relationship between lung cancer risk and air pollution levels, utilizing data from a comprehensive study by the journal Nature Medicine. The study includes data from over 462,000 individuals in China who live in regions with varying levels of air pollution. We seek to investigate how different atmospheric conditions affect lung cancer risk, modeling these conditions as a categorical variable to analyze their impact. Made as a part of David Kane's Data Science, this final modelling project will provide insights into the correlation between environmental factors and lung cancer susceptibility.
